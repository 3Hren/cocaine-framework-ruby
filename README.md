Framework provides the following features:

 * Ruby client, which allows you to communicate with Cocaine Infrastructure natively from your Ruby code.
 * Server-side helpers to ease creation your own Ruby workers.
 * Fiber-aware actor-based backend powered by [Celluloid](http://celluloid.io/), which provides painless multithreaded programming for Ruby.
 * Rack interface support, which allows you to deploy your [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) or [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) applications without any change.
