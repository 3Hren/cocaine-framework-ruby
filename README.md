Introducing cocaine-framework-ruby
========================================

Here you are, almighty Ruby programmers! Introducing another framework for our Cocaine Cloud.
This time it is cocaine-framework-ruby.

 * Requires at least Ruby 1.9

Framework provides next features:

 * ability to create your own apps and upload it to the Cloud.
 * ability to use other Cloud services or apps.
 * explicit future-based asynchronous backend to maximize performance without using threads.
 * fiber-aware asynchronous backend to make your asynchronous code look like it is synchronous.
 * integration with our http-proxy for simple applications.
 * [In the nearest future], Ruby on Rails support.
